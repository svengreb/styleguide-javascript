## Improvements

<details>
<summary><strong>Allow <code>void</code> operator as a statement for React Hooks</strong> — #55 ⇄ #56 (⊶ af9c38b8)</summary>

↠ To run `async` code in a React [`useEffect` Hook][242] the [official React Hook FAQ section about how to fetch data][241] recommends and [shows in a demo][234] how to define a scoped fat arrow function and run it immediately. Unfortunately this collided with the [`@typescript/no-floating-promises`][238] rule because the returned `Promise` of the called function must not be handled anymore.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const init = async () => {
    try {
      const data = await fetchData();
      setInitialized(isInit);
      if (data) initStores(data);
    } catch (err) {
      handleError(err);
    }
  };
  // This will trigger the "@typescript/no-floating-promises" rule because the returned "Promise" is not handled.
  init();
}, [fetchData, handleError, initStores, setInitialized]);
```

Explicitly disabling the rule for these specific code lines would have been an option, but it is recommended to [use the `void` operator instead][240].

```tsx
// ...
// This will trigger the "no-void" rule because the "void" operator is currently not allowed as a statement.
void init();
// ...
```

However, the [`no-void`][235] rule did not allow the `void` operator to be used as statement which resulted in this rule to also throw an error.
To resolve both problems, the [`allowAsStatement` option][236] of the `no-void` rule has been enabled.

Also see [typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint#1184][239] where this solution is also recommended by one of the `@typescript-eslint` package maintainers.

## Improvements

<details>
<summary><strong><code>@arcticicestudio/remark-preset-lint</code> migration</strong> — #47 ⇄ #48 (⊶ 90953d7c)</summary>

↠ The `remark-preset-lint-arcticicestudio` package has been deprecated [during the migration into a monorepo][231] and replaced by the new [`@arcticicestudio/remark-preset-lint` package][230]. This package also [introduced support for remark `13.0.0`][232] which comes with some new features and great improvements.
To migrate to the new package the `remark-preset-lint-arcticicestudio` preset has been replaced by the new `@arcticicestudio/remark-preset-lint` preset in the `.remarkrc.js` file.

</details>

## Bug Fixes

<details>
<summary><strong>Invalid usage of <code>prettier/@typescript-eslint</code> configuration</strong> — #49 ⇄ #52 (⊶ c1aca60a)</summary>

↠ As of [`eslint-config-prettier`][19] version [`8.0.0`][17] all configurations have been merged into the `prettier` configuration that now includes not just ESLint core rules, but also rules from all plugins.
In #32 the `eslint-config-prettier` version was bumped from version [v6.0.0 to v8.1.0][18], but the `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-typescript` package still explicitly extends the `prettier/@typescript-eslint` configuration which results in an error when consuming the package.

To fix this problem, the `prettier/@typescript-eslint` has been removed entirely from the `extend` field, leaving only the all-in-one `prettier` configuration.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Loop on TypeScript configuration override</strong> — #50 ⇄ #53 (⊶ ddc16cc7)</summary>

↠ In #32 the `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-typescript` package migrated to the latest plugin versions and added [the `override` field][228] to its index to simplify the usage for consumers by removing the need to explicitly define it per project. Unfortunately this resulted in a crash loop when doing so and also blocked users from overriding single rules based on the project needs.

To fix this problem, the `override` field has been removed again, leaving it up to the user to define and customize the ESLint configuration for TypeScript to fit the project needs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Invalid usage of <code>prettier/@typescript-eslint</code> configuration </strong> — #51 ⇄ #54 (⊶ aba45876)</summary>

↠ TypeScript uses [triple-slash directives][233] (single-line comments containing a single XML tag) to define compiler directives. The `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base` configures the ESLint core rule [`spaced-comment`][227] and already defines exceptions and comment markers for special use cases, but did not support triple-slash directives. When running `eslint --fix` these comments in `*.d.ts` files were malformed (`///` → `// /`) which resulted in invalid TypeScript syntax.

To support triple-slash directives, the `/` marker has been added to the `line` field.

## Features

<details>
<summary><strong>Update ESLint and plugins</strong> — #31 ⇄ #32 (⊶ 486b2d18)</summary>

↠ ESLint and most of the used plugins released new major versions so trying to use later versions of these plugins as well as ESLint itself caused errors when using npm v7 because [peer dependencies are installed automatically][177] now, which is a fantastic change, but also breaks and blocks the usage of the configuration packages due to outdated `peerDependencies` like `eslint@^6`.

### Core

The latest version 7 comes with great features and improvements.
See the [official v7 migration guide][157] for all details.

- **Updated ESLint package version** — updated from [`v6.2.0` to `v7.23.0`][179].
- **Allowed to define additional file extensions in configuration packages** — [files matched by `overrides[].files` are now linted by default][159] which allows to add extensions like `*.ts` and `*.tsx` to the `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-typescript` without the need to specify this override over and over again in each project.
- **Removed deprecated rules** — [some rules have been deprecated][158] and have been removed in favor of the support for `eslint-plugin-node` like documented in #30.
  - [`callback-return`][161] → [`node/callback-return`][188]
  - [`global-require`][162] → [`node/global-require`][189]
  - [`handle-callback-err`][163] → [`node/handle-callback-err`][190]
  - [`no-mixed-requires`][166] → [`node/no-mixed-requires`][191]
  - [`no-new-require`][167] → [`node/no-new-require`][192]
  - [`no-path-concat`][168] → [`node/no-path-concat`][193]
  - [`no-process-env`][169] → [`node/no-process-env`][194]
  - [`no-process-exit`][170] → [`node/no-process-exit`][195]
  - [`no-restricted-modules`][171] → [`node/no-restricted-modules`][196]
  - [`no-sync`][173] → [`node/no-sync`][197]
- **Adapted new recommended rules** — some rules have been [added and enabled on the `eslint:recommended` rule set][160] and have ben added to `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base` with `error` level:
  - [`no-dupe-else-if`][164]
  - [`no-import-assign`][165]
  - [`no-setter-return`][172]

### Plugins & Dependencies

#### `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config`

- [eslint-config-prettier][19] — Bumped version from [`v6.0.0` to `v8.1.0`][18]. As of [version `8.0.0` all rule sets have been merged into the main `prettier` set][17]. Therefore the additional `prettier/react` set has been removed from the `extends` array of the Prettier specific rules.
- [eslint-find-rules][206] — Bumped version from [`v3.4.0` to `v3.6.1`][205].
- [eslint-plugin-import][14] — Bumped minimum version from [`v2.18.2` to `v2.22.1`][176].
- [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y][185] — Bumped minimum version from [`v6.2.3` to `v6.4.1`][184].
- [eslint-plugin-prettier][20] — Bumped minimum version from [`v3.1.0` to `v3.3.1`][200].
- [eslint-plugin-react][25] — Bumped minimum version from [`v7.14.3` to `v7.23.1`][224]. This includes new rules and improvements to existing ones:
  - Added new [`react/jsx-no-useless-fragment`][220] rule with `error` level (introduced in [`v7.15.0`][213]) that disallows unnecessary fragments.
  - Added the new `static-variables` option to the [`react/sort-comp`][223] rule (introduced in [`v7.15.0`][213]).
  - Added new [`react/jsx-newline`][217] rule (introduced in [`v7.22.0`][214]) and disable by default.
  - Added new [`react/jsx-no-constructed-context-values`][218] rule (introduced in [`v7.22.0`][214]) and enabled it by default to prevent react contexts from taking non-stable values.
    > React Context, and all its child nodes and Consumers are rerendered whenever the value prop changes. Because each Javascript object carries its own identity, things like object expressions (`{foo: "bar"}`) or function expressions get a new identity on every run through the component. This makes the context think it has gotten a new object and can cause needless rerenders and unintended consequences.
    > This can be a pretty large performance hit because not only will it cause the context providers and consumers to rerender with all the elements in its subtree, the processing for the tree scan react does to render the provider and find consumers is also wasted.
  - Added `enforceDynamicLinks` option with value `always` for [`react/jsx-no-target-blank`][219] rule (introduced in [`v7.9.0`][216])
  - Added [`react/no-unstable-nested-components`][221] rule and enabled it by default to prevent creating unstable components inside components.
    > Creating components inside components without memoization leads to unstable components. The nested component and all its children are recreated during each re-render. Given stateful children of the nested component will lose their state on each re-render.
    > React reconcilation performs element type comparison with [reference equality][181]. The reference to the same element changes on each re-render when defining components inside the render block. This leads to complete recreation of the current node and all its children. As a result the virtual DOM has to do extra unnecessary work and possible bugs are introduced.
  - Added `forbidDefaultForRequired` option with value `true` for [`react/require-default-props`][222] rule (introduced in [`v7.5.0`][215])
- [eslint-plugin-react-hooks][145] — Bumped minimum version from `v2.0.0` to [`v4.2.0`][180].

#### `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base`

- [confusing-browser-globals][106] — Bumped minimum version from `v1.0.8` to `v1.0.10`.
- [eslint-find-rules][206] — Bumped version from [`v3.4.0` to `v3.6.1`][205].
- [eslint-plugin-import][14] — Bumped minimum version from [`v2.18.2` to `v2.22.1`][176].

#### `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-typescript`

- [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin][211] — Bumped minimum version from [`v2.0.0` to `v4.20.0`][210].
- [@typescript-eslint/parser][23] — Bumped minimum version from [`v2.0.0` to `v4.20.0`][210].
- [typescript][187] — Bumped minimum version from [`v3.5.3` to `v4.2.3`][186].

## Improvements

<details>
<summary><strong>Migrate to "tmpl" template repository</strong> — #35 ⇄ #36 (⊶ e6709a9c)</summary>

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/svengreb/tmpl/blob/main/assets/images/repository-hero.svg?raw=true"/></p>

↠ Migrated the project setup, structure and development workflow [from version 0.9.0][225] of the [“tmpl“ template repository][226].
Additionally specific assets like the repository hero image have been replaced and documentations like the _README_ and GitHub issue/PR templates have been adjusted.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Move ESLint Prettier support into base package</strong> — #37 ⇄ #38 (⊶ a50130e0)</summary>

↠ Before [eslint-plugin-prettier][20] and its corresponding [eslint-config-prettier][19] package were supported by the [@arcticicestudio/eslint-config][209] rule preset package. This worked fine for most projects, but also pulled in React specific dependencies like [eslint-plugin-react][25] and [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y][185].
To allow to use Prettier without `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config`, the support has been moved into the `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base` package, including the optional entry point.

</details>

## Tasks

<details>
<summary><strong>Node.js package dependency & GitHub action version updates</strong> — #24, #23, #33 ⇄ #27, #34</summary>

- #33 ⇄ #34 (⊶ e4fd1653) **Removed `--ext` option for ESLint tasks** — as of ESLint v7, [files matched by `overrides[].files` are now linted by default][159] which makes it obsolete to explicitly define file extensions like `*.js`.

**React Hooks support and entry point** — #17 ⇄ #18 (⊶ 833cc51d)
↠ All React based projects using at least React version [16.8][152] that introduced the awesome [Hooks][153]. Since this comes with a [entire new API][153] that follows new design/usage pattern, the React team created an official [„Hooks“ ESLint plugin][145] to help to adhere to the [„Rules of Hooks“][154].

Since the `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config` package already includes support for React and „JSX A11Y“, support for _Hooks_ has also been added through a new shareable configuration entry point that

- enables the `react-hooks` plugin.
- configures both currently available rules `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` and `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule to `error` level.

Because _Hooks_ make more use of arrow functions the [`react/jsx-no-bind`][140] has been adjusted to prevent compatibility problems by allowing setting the `ignoreDOMComponents` and `allowArrowFunctions` options to `true`.
The `react/display-name` rule has also been disabled in order to prevent problems due to missing _display names_ for _functional components_ that make use of _Hooks_ instead of being created through a _class_ component.

The new entry point is available as `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config/react-hooks` and can be composed with all other [available entry points][13] to inherit their rules.

This feature adds the `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` package as new peer dependency for `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config`.

**ESLint TypeScript Configuration Package** — #19 ⇄ #20 (⊶ 484c981d)
↠ To support projects build with [TypeScript][35], a new `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-typescript` package has been implemented using the awesome [@typescript-eslint][149] project. It mainly extends `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`'s [already provided and recommended configurations][148] in order to adapt best practices:

1. `plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended`
2. `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`
3. `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-requiring-type-checking`

The [`@typescript-eslint/parser`][23] is set as ESLint parser. As of [`@typescript-eslint/parser` version `2.0.0`][147] (also see [typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint#890][150]), the parser will panic when parsing files that are not included within the provided _tsconfig(s)_.
The documentation of the new package contains instructions and a quick setup and usage guide to inform about the [required `tsconfig` configurations][146] and the corresponding `eslintrc` changes.

Next to the support for TypeScript, the package also modifies some _React_ and _import_ related rules in order to prevent conflicts, like the adaption of the `.ts` and `.tsx` extensions for all JS and JSX files as well as removing `.jsx` to force the usage of `.tsx`. There are other rules that have been disabled like the check for valid React `prop-types` since these and not necessary anymore when working with TypeScript.

The new package provides two entry points, available as `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-typescript` and `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-typescript/prettier` that can both be composed with all other [available entry points][13] to inherit their rules.

This package mainly depends on the `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@^2.0.0` and `@typescript-eslint/parser@^2.0.0` packages as peer dependencies.

**From CircleCI to GitHub Actions** — #21 ⇄ #22 (⊶ c7d663eb)
↠ The project migrated from [CircleCI][135] as CI/CD service to the awesome new [GitHub Actions][141] that is smoothly integrated into the GitHub platform and page for a „single-source-of-truth“ developer experience: OPS configurations as code right next to the source code in the repository.

##### Previous Project State

The previous project setup used [CircleCI][135] with [API version 2.x][134] as CI/CD service. This worked great, but also comes with the disadvantage of being decoupled from the repository.

</p>

During _GitHub Universe 2018_, the awesome new [GitHub Actions][141] feature was [introduced and launched as closed beta][138]. Luckily _Sven Greb_ was given access in order to test all the great possibilities. During the [GitHub Actions stream „Now with built-in CI/CD!“ (live from GitHub HQ)][156] the _Actions_ update was announced and previewed showing the expansion to use _GitHub Actions_ as [CI/CD service described as „fast CI/CD for any OS, any language, and any cloud“][137].

**See the [official GitHub Actions documentation][143] for details about setups, features, the configuration API and many more!**

##### Project Integration

The switch from _CircleCI_ to _GitHub Actions_ brought many advantages like a „close-to-the-source“ development pipeline. Having the code and automated pipelines/workflows in one place is worth a lot. This also comes along with the perfect and smooth integrations into the GitHub platform and page itself like status reports on PRs and many more possibilities like the [customization and triggering of workflows through webhooks][142] for almost every event that can occur in a repository/issue/PR etc.

To integrate _GitHub Actions_ the previous [_CircleCI_ build configuration][136] has been adapted and adjusted. The official [starter-workflows][144] were used as inspiration as well as showcase projects like [Yarn _Berry_ (Yarn v2)][151] also presented during the announcement livestream.

Next to the `starter-workflows` repository the [official _GitHub Actions_ documentation][143] was the main source of information to set up the project workflows.

  </figure>
</p>

Since _GitHub Actions_ are still in closed/limited public beta, there is no support for SVG badges through [shields.io][32]. Anyway, there are (currently undocumented) official badges provided by the GitHub API that are used until _Actions_ goes _GA_ and [shields.io][32] implements support for it: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/workflows/{workflow_name}/badge.svg`

## Epics

**Monorepo with ESLint packages** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↠ Resolved the epic by converting the repository into a [monorepo][34] and migrating the [`@arcticicestudio/eslint-config`][22] (previously `eslint-config-arcticicestudio`) + [`@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base`][21] (previously `eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base`) packages!

#### Previous Project State

Previously this repository only contained the actual styleguide documentation while specific projects that implement the guidelines for linters and code style analyzer lived in separate repositories. This was the best approach for modularity and a small and clear code base, but it increased the maintenance overhead by 1(n) since changes to the development workflow or toolbox, general project documentations as well as dependency management required changes in every repository with dedicated tickets/issues and PRs. In particular, Node packages require frequent dependency management due to their fast development cycles to keep up-to-date with the latest package changes like (security) bug fixes.

This styleguide is currently implemented by the [`@arcticicestudio/eslint-config`][22] (previously `eslint-config-arcticicestudio`) and [`@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base`][21] (previously `eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base`) Node packages that lived in their own repositories. The development workflow was clean using most of GitHub's awesome features like project boards, _codeowner_ assignments, issue & PR automation and so on, but changes to one of them often required actions for the other package too since they are based on each other and they are using the same development tooling and documentation standards.

##### Monorepo Comparison

Actually I'm not a supporter when it comes to [monorepos][34] and next to the advantages a monorepo also comes with disadvantages:

- **No more scoped code** — The developer experience with Git is clearly worse because commits can contains changes to multiple scopes of the code. Since there are only a “transparent separation” of code, that was previously located in a dedicated repository but is not aggregated into a parent (e.g. `packages`) with other modules, commits can now contain changes to multiple code scopes spread over the entire code base.
- **No more assignment of commits to single modules** — Like described in the bullet point above, commit can contain changes to multiple modules, it is harder to detect which commit targeted a specific module.
- **Steeper learning curve for new contributors** — In a dedicated repository that only hosts a specific module it is easier for new developers to contribute to the project, but in a monorepo they might need to change code in multiple places within other modules or the root code/documentation of the entire project.
- **Uniform version number** — In order to keep conform to [SemVer][31], the entire project must use a uniform version number. This means that a module that has not been changed since the last version must also be incremented in order to keep compatible with the other modules.
  Using different version numbers prefixed/suffixed with an individual version number **is a not go**, **increases the maintenance overhead** and **and drastically reduces the project overview and quality**! This would result in multiple Git tags on the `main` branch as well as “empty” changelogs and release notes with placeholder logs that only refer to changes of other modules.

#### Project Future

Even though there are disadvantages (see above), a [monorepo][34] makes sense **only for specific project modules thar are slightly coupled** and where using dedicated repositories only increases the maintenance overhead **when changes must be reflected in multiple modules anyway**.

In order to reduce the maintenance overhead both Node packages, [`@arcticicestudio/eslint-config`][22] (previously `eslint-config-arcticicestudio`) and [`@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base`][21] (previously `eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base`), have been migrated into this repository by adapting to [Yarn workspaces][133] since they are slightly dependent on each other anyway. This simplifies the development tooling setup and allows to use a unified documentation base as well as a smoother development and testing workflow.

This change also implies that the root of the repository is now the main package for the entire project setup including shared development dependencies, tools and documentations while the packages only contains specific configurations and (dev)dependencies.

##### Scoped Packages

The previous `eslint-config-arcticicestudio` and `eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base` packages were no [scoped packages][132] but suffixed with `-arcticicestudio*`. To simplify the naming and improving the usage of user/organization specific packages both packages are now scoped to `@arcticicestudio` resulting in the new names `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base` and `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config`. They can be used through [ESLint's support for shared configuration with scoped packages][117].
The previously released public versions [have been deprecated using the `npm deprecate` command][131] where the provided message points out to migrate to the new scoped packages.

##### Versioning

The style guide itself and all packages using a shared/fixed/locked version. This helps all packages to keep in sync and ensure the compatibility with the latest style guide version.

##### Standard Setup

In order to keep up-to-date with the latest project setups, the tools and documentations have been integrated and updated through the following tickets:

- #9 (⊶ 8e992407) „Git ignore and attribute pattern“ — completed ✓
- #10 (⊶ db2a43bc) „Git mail mapping“ — completed ✓
- #11 (⊶ 10253246) „Prettier“ — completed ✓
- #12 (⊶ c21a58a9) „lint-staged“ — completed ✓

- #14 (⊶ be122b12) „General repository and package documentations and metadata“ — completed ✓
- #15 (⊶ c25d1efe) „GitHub issue and pull request templates“ — completed ✓

## Features

**GitHub issue and pull request templates** — #15 (⊶ c25d1efe)
↠ Integrated GitHub's feature to define [multiple issue templates][119] while the [initial template file][118] is used as a fallback/generic template to link to the specific ones.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/63289697-fff06f00-c2bf-11e9-9e33-f11870d7c2f2.png" width="250" /></p>

Read the [GitHub Help article][123] for more details about issue and pull request templates. Also check out how to manually create [issue templates][124], a [pull request template][122]. and the guide on [how to create the (deprecated) fallback/generic issue template][121].

## Improvements

**General repository and package documentations and metadata** — #14 (⊶ be122b12)
↠ The previous project repository documentations were not designed for a [monorepo][34] layout and have been be updated including various badges provided by the great [shields.io][32] project.

Further documentations about the project architecture and technologies as well as guides for contributions to develop, run and maintain the project stayed within the packages itself.
There are also various places that contained outdated documentations and metadata that have been updated too.

See #14 for more details about what exactly has been updated.

## Tasks

**Ignore `__mocks__` for `import/no-extraneous-dependencies`** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Ported from airbnb/javascript#1772 (⊶ airbnb/javascript@8720f5f9)
↠ Added the `__mocks__` pattern as exception for the [`import/no-extraneous-dependencies`][52] rule since it should be considered as testing utils.

**Underscore naming pattern for `spec` tests** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Ported from airbnb/javascript#1732 (⊶ airbnb/javascript@8c83d03a)

↳ Ported from airbnb/javascript#1907 (⊶ airbnb/javascript@17e04546)
↠ Dangling underscores and not allowed for functions and are now enforced through the [`no-underscore-dangle`][104] rule.

**Allow `staticContext` (_React Router_) for `no-param-reassign`** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Ported from airbnb/javascript#2029 (⊶ airbnb/javascript@1310ade9)
↠ Added `staticContext` ([_React Router_][115]) as exception for the [`no-param-reassign`][101] rule.

**Switch from `eslint-restricted-globals` to `confusing-browser-globals`** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Ported from airbnb/javascript#1961 (⊶ airbnb/javascript@21b65e94)
↠ Switched from the superseded [`eslint-restricted-globals`][112] package to the new [`confusing-browser-globals`][106] package that is part of the official React repository, used within [CRA][1] and maintained by the React core team.

**Allow `jest.setup.js` file name pattern for `import/no-extraneous-dependencies`** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Ported from airbnb/javascript#1998 (⊶ airbnb/javascript@96f95fa3)
↠ Added the `jest.setup.js` file name pattern to the exceptions of the [`import/no-extraneous-dependencies`][52] rule to support the general naming of [Jest][26] setup files.

## Bug Fixes

### Style Guide

**Updated link anchor for MDN page about `let` keyword** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Ported from airbnb/javascript#1818 (⊶ airbnb/javascript@c068d7cb)
↠ Fixed an anchor on the [“Hoisting”][76] page for a MDN link about [„temporal dead zones“][113] of the `let` keyword.

**Invalid link anchor for W3 page about „ARIA Roles“` keyword** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Ported from airbnb/javascript#1823 (⊶ airbnb/javascript@8a244801)
↠ Fixed an anchor on the [React Accessibility A11Y][82] page for a W3 link about [“ARIA roles”][116].

**Invalid example for npm `has` package** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Ported from airbnb/javascript#2062 (⊶ airbnb/javascript@030e23b1)
↠ Fixed an error in the usage example of the [`has`][114] package in the [„Object Rest Spread“][81] section.

↳ Ported from airbnb/javascript#1794, airbnb/javascript#2017 (⊶ airbnb/javascript@2d977990, airbnb/javascript@60b96d32)
↠ Changed the `maxEOF` option of the [`no-multiple-empty-lines`][100] rule to `0` since ESLint by default [swallows the final newline, as some editors add it automatically][107]. This prevents an additional new line at the end of files next to the default _EOF_ handling.

**Entry point for Prettier plugin integration** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio#12 ⇄ arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio#15~~ (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio@8935d75a~~)
↠ All projects using [Prettier][29] for a smooth and uncomplicated developer experience as well as keeping the code style consistent across own and third-party projects.
Almost all projects have added the [eslint-plugin-prettier][20] plugin to run Prettier as an ESLint rule and report differences as individual ESLint issues.

Therefore a new entry point has been added that

- enables the `prettier` plugin.
- enables the `prettier/prettier` rule to `error` level in order to enable the linting output.
- extends the official Prettier ESLint configuration from the [`eslint-config-prettier` package][19] to ensure the best compatibility with Prettier as well as reducing required maintenance overhead to keep up-to-date with new Prettier releases. It also extends the following shared configurations to include support for other ESLint plugins:
  - `eslint-plugin-react` through the shared `prettier/react` configuration

The new entry point is available as `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config/prettier` and can be composed with the default entry point to inherit the rules and include all existing integrations like for „React“ and „JSX A11Y“.

**ESLint v6.0.0 Support** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio#13 ⇄ arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio#14 (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio@6948a181~~)
↠ [ESLint v6 has been released][7] including the official [v6 migration guide][8].
To stay up-to-date with the latest security and stability changes as well as new rules, this configuration migrated to v6 while also dropping support for v4 and lower.

##### Updated (dev,peer)dependencies for ESLint v6.0.0 support

To stay up-to-date with the latest security and stability changes as well as new rules, all outdated (dev,peer)dependencies have been updated.

##### Updated React plugin settings

The version has been changed to be automatically detected by using the `detect` value and the `pragma` key has been removed since it will be handled by Babel.

##### Added new React and JSX A11Y plugin rules and adapted new default values

The `react` and `jsx-a11y` plugins introduced new rules as well as updating default values and configurations of existing ones.
The missing rules have been added while the default values have been compared and adjusted to the current configurations of this package.

##### Removed deprecated plugin rules

The following rules have been deprecated and therefore removed or replaced:

- [`jsx-a11y/label-has-for`][71] - Replaced by [`label-has-associated-control`][70].

#### `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base`

**No `quote-props` for numbers and keywords** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#29 (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio@bbb6d35a~~)
↠ Disabled the [keywords][67] and [numbers][68] options of the `quote-props` rule. Both are not necessary anymore since this preset does not target legacy ES3 environments and disabling prevents unnecessary and noisy warnings.

↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio#10 (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio@cf8a9744~~)
↠ Disabled the [65][] rule because it was actually too noisy and prevented the usage of useful shortcut props like `outlined` or `loaded`.

**No more consistent naming validation for JSX boolean props** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio#11 (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio@27e75c91~~)
↠ The `callbacksLast` and `shorthandFirst` options of the [66][] rule caused multiple warnings when formatted with [Prettier][29] and conflicted with the alphabetically ordering and have therefore been **disabled**.

#### `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base`

**No more JSDoc comment validation** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#28 (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base@eab37dd2~~)
↠ Disabled the [`valid-jsdoc`][63] core rule because it is actually too noisy and not suitable in most cases when used with JSX/React and some of the latest ES6 (or higher) features/proposals when the return type is not known. When using [TypeScript][35] or [Flow][11] the return type and parameters are typed.

**Prevent _SemVer Major Zero Caveat_** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio#8 ⇄ arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio#9~~ (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio@daa1ea3e~~)
↠ Raised the version range for the [base package][21] to `>=0.2.0 <1.0.0` in order to avoid the _SemVer Major Zero Caveat_.

This prevents that only the exact version specified will match. By allowing all versions `<1.0.0` this package resolves to the latest development version when a new version of the base package is released without the need to manually update to the version.

#### `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base`

**No more minimum amount of properties for `object-curly-newline`** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#26 ⇄ arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#27~~ (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base@1c4ee04b~~)
↠ Removed the minimum amount of properties for the [`object-curly-newline`][60] rule so the `consistent` option ensures that the style is consistent for every case.

Previously it was configured to require a line break when there are 4 or more properties within the object curly braces on the same line. This resulted in noisy errors because the names can also be very short and fit perfectly into one line e.g. when used with React prop [destructuring][28].

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/63180525-c107b280-c04e-11e9-8a88-9577be9b93c9.png" width="66%"/></p>

Because [Prettier][29] is used in all project development workflows, the indentation is automatically handled when the length of the properties exceeds the maximum line length or reduces the readability. Therefore the decision to use a line break or not should be handled by Prettier instead of using a hard coded amount value.

This improvement also added the `ImportDeclaration` and `ExportDeclaration` configurations, introduced in [ESLint version 4.18.0][62], to avoid different behavior when updating to this version.

↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio#4 ⇄ arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio#5~~ (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio@0a444a20~~)
↠ Added the new React 16.3 lifecycle method [`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`][58] and the now deprecated (“async unsafe“) lifecycle `React.Component` methods, prefixed with `UNSAFE_`, to the except methods of the [`class-methods-use-this`][40] core rule.
Previously this resulted in a warning when no `this` keyword was used within the method.

↠ Updated to the latest [base package][21] version [0.2.0][45] that added support for new ESLint core and plugin rules as well as many other improvements and bug fixes.

#### `@arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base`

**Import-related rule refactoring** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#6 ⇄ arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#12~~ (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base@8395e07d~~)
↠ Refactored rules related to imports that caused many style based warnings regarding ordering and sorting of `import` statements.

###### Import Order Conflict

The [`import/first`][49] and [`import/order`][55] rules were conflicting. While `import/first` disallowed

```js
import "../config";
import fs from "fs"; // <-- Error: Absolute imports should come before relative imports
import App from "../App";
```

`import/order` on the other hand was fine with this as mentioned in the rule documentation:

> Unassigned imports are ignored, as the order they are imported in may be important.

This has been improved by allowing unassigned imports anywhere, **but still above all other non-import statements**.

Also the import groups have been specified more accurate by splitting them into three main groups:

1. _builtin_ and _external_ modules
2. _internal_ modules (e.g. if configured via webpack to handle internal paths differently)
3. _parent_, _sibling_ and _index_ modules

These three groups must be separated by a blank line.

###### Import Sort Conflict

The [`sort-imports`][44] rule conflicted with both of the other mentioned rules described above. It is not that important how imports are sorted within groups so this rule has been disabled until there's a way to make it work regarding the compatibility with other rules.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/63178408-45a40200-c04a-11e9-840b-a4f214690d61.png" width="66%"/></p>

**Allow line break for arrow function implicit returns** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#7 ⇄ arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#17~~ (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base@fa3d6e8c~~)
↠ Line breaks are now allowed for implicit returns of arrow functions.
Previously it was configured to enforce the implicit return statement to be beside the arrow. This prevented longer statements to be placed on the next line to improve the readability and compliance with the maximum line length. These restrictions have now been lifted.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/63178529-84d25300-c04a-11e9-9aca-b64f43123b36.png" width="66%"/></p>

**No default case for switch block** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#9 ⇄ arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#19~~ (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base@1d9ad4ef~~)
↠ _switch-case_ blocks no longer require a `default` case. The [`default-case`][59] rule has been disabled, because most of the time a `default` case is not necessary and should be handled by the developer depending on the use case and code scope.

**Use line breaks after operators** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#10 ⇄ arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#20~~ (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base@9894f0d8~~)
↠ Line breaks are now placed **after** operators instead **before** them. Previously the [`operator-linebreak`][43] core rule was configured to enforce line breaks to be placed before operators which could lead to confusions when indenting lines because of the [maximum line length][42]. It now enforces line breaks after operators, but exceptions for the [conditional (ternary) operators][27] `?` and `:` are configured to use line breaks before.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/63178982-69b41300-c04b-11e9-9662-42dba926015b.png" width="66%"/></p>

**Gatsby configuration file pattern for `devDependencies` imports** — #8 ⇄ #16 (⊶ ac611f7e)
↳ Transferred from ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#11 ⇄ arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base#21~~ (⊶ ~~arcticicestudio/eslint-config-arcticicestudio-base@581fd812~~)
↠ The [`import/no-extraneous-dependencies`][52] rule now allows the import of `devDependencies` in [Gatsby][12] configuration, currently including the following pattern:

```raw
gatsby-browser.js
gatsby-config.js
gatsby-node.js
gatsby-ssr.js
```

These pattern should match all of the listed files as well as new files that might possibly be added in the future.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/63179061-9e27cf00-c04b-11e9-87e9-f2f9e78bff3e.png" width="66%"/></p>

↠ Line breaks within function parentheses are now consistent.
Previously the [`function-paren-newline`][41] core rule was configured with `multiline` that only allowed a line break after the opening brace when the parameter also contains a line break, otherwise it disallows any line break within the parentheses.

This was [not conform with the styleguide][2] and has been changed to the `consistent` option. This requires consistent usage of line breaks for each pair of parentheses. It reports an error if one parenthesis in the pair has a line break inside it and the other parenthesis does not.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7836623/63179464-72f1af80-c04c-11e9-80b3-b5c39b109e98.png" width="66%"/></p>

↠ The installation of peer dependencies for CI/CD build (Circle CI) has been removed from the build configuration.

It was set up to run the `npx` command to install the peer dependencies that is only required for users of the package, but not the package itself. The same dependencies are defined in `devDependencies` and therefore installed by default on `npm install`.
